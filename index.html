      <h2>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</h2>
      <p>
        Approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to COVID-19 on
        death certificates reported to CDC (1). Concerns have been raised that
        some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of
        International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
        diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and
        efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are
        being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses
        co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death
        certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22,
        2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133
        (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only
        U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one
        other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to
        have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event
        condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant
        contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both.
        Overall, 70%–80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event
        condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event
        condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18–84 years, both males
        and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in
        inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those
        whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the
        accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using
        official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring
        diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and
        authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for
        professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the
        pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for
        understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that
        causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public
        health action. Death certificates were processed using standard CDC
        protocols to convert all written text and diagnoses to ICD-10 codes (4).
        Individual data elements were extracted for analysis from death
        certificates that had the ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) listed in
        Part I (the section for reporting chain of events leading directly to
        death, the immediate cause of death, and the underlying cause of death)
        or Part II (the section for reporting all other significant conditions
        that contributed to death) of the death certificate for deaths that
        occurred during the calendar year 2020 (Supplementary Figure,
        https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/104571) (3) and had been reported to CDC
        by February 22, 2021. First, the location of ICD-10 diagnoses in
        relation to the COVID-19 diagnosis was used to categorize the
        co-occurring diagnoses as being in the chain of events that directly
        caused the death (chain-of-event conditions) or a significant condition
        contributing to death (significant contributing conditions). Any
        co-occurring ICD-10 code that appeared on the same line or above U07.1
        in Part I was considered to be a chain-of-event condition. Any ICD-10
        code that appeared on a line below U07.1 in Part I or in Part II was
        considered to be a contributing condition. Second, the highest-frequency
        ICD-10 codes noted in ≥1% of all death certificates with COVID-19 listed
        in Part I and at least one diagnosis other than COVID-19 were reviewed
        for consistency and plausibility with conditions known to be associated
        with severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (5–8). Conditions
        consistent with those known to be associated with severe COVID-19
        outcomes were coded as chain-of-event or significant contributing
        conditions regardless of their location on the death certificate. For
        example, a death certificate with an ICD-10 code for respiratory failure
        listed below U07.1 would be coded as a chain-of-event condition because
        respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 led directly to the death. Third,
        less frequently appearing ICD-10 codes that were determined to be
        consistent with those associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes were also
        coded as chain-of-event or significant contributing conditions. Finally,
        death certificates were categorized into five mutually exclusive
        categories according to the ICD-10 codes recorded on the death
        certificate 1) only the ICD-10 code for COVID-19; 2) at least one other
        co-occurring ICD-10 code for a chain-of-event condition; 3) at least one
        other co-occurring ICD-10 code for a significant contributing condition;
        4) an ICD-10 code for both a chain-of-event and significant contributing
        condition; or 5) an ICD-10 code that could not be categorized as a
        plausible chain-of-event or significant contributing condition based on
        current knowledge. Results were stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity,
        and setting of death reported on the death certificate. All analyses
        were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and Stata (version
        15.0; StataCorp). Among 378,048 death certificates with the ICD-10 code
        U07.1, 94.5% (357,133) had at least one other ICD-10 code, whereas 5.5%
        (20,915) listed only U07.1 (Table 1); 330,198 (87%) listed COVID-19 in
        Part I. Death certificates with only U07.1 and no other diagnosis
        accounted for 2.9%–6.6% of death certificates for decedents across all
        age, sex, and racial/ethnic categories (Table 1). Having only COVID-19
        listed on the death certificate was slightly more frequent for death
        certificates that listed “dead on arrival” (34; 10%) or “decedent’s
        home” (2,006; 8.6%) as the place of death or “pending” (seven; 13.5%) as
        the manner of death. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with
        at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates)
        were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible
        chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia, respiratory failure, adult
        respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrest, or sepsis), or
        significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension, diabetes,
        dementia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) (5), or both. The
        most frequent chain-of-event ICD-10 diagnosis codes on 330,198 death
        certificates that listed COVID-19 on Part I of the death certificate
        were J18.9 (pneumonia) (45%) and J96.0 (acute respiratory failure) (20%)
        (Table 2); the most frequent significant contributing condition ICD-10
        codes were I10 (essential hypertension) (18%) and E14.9 (diabetes
        mellitus) (10%). Nearly 75% of all death certificates had a
        chain-of-event condition, alone or in combination with a significant
        contributing condition; this finding was noted for adults aged 18–84
        years, males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those
        who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings,
        and those whose manner of death was listed as natural (Table 1). Nearly
        18% of death certificates had a co-occurring significant contributing
        condition only (Table 1). This finding was more frequent for death
        certificates indicating that the death occurred in the decedent’s home
        (38.3%), a nursing home or long-term care facility (38.5%), or hospice
        facility (23.2%). A small proportion (9,638; 2.5%) of death certificates
        had co-occurring diagnosis codes that could not be plausibly categorized
        as either a chain-of-event or significant contributing condition. This
        finding was more frequent among decedents aged 18 years (64; 35.2%) and
        18–29 years (145; 10.2%); these age groups represented only 0.4% (1,608)
        of all death certificates. This was recorded more frequently among
        decedents who died at home (1,259; 5.4%), were declared “dead on
        arrival” (15; 4.4%), or whose manner of death was self-inflicted (39;
        63.9%), homicide (13; 43.8%), “could not determine” (18; 26.5%), or
        accidental (417; 20.0%). Deaths reported from inpatient settings
        accounted for 240,770 (64%) of all death certificates; 86% of these had
        co-occurring diagnoses identified as chain-of-event and significant
        contributing conditions (104,250; 43%) or chain-of-event conditions only
        (103,475; 43%). A higher proportion of deaths reported from nursing
        homes or long-term care facilities (22% of all death certificates)
        listed contributing conditions only (39%) on the death certificate.
        Contributing conditions were also noted in a larger proportion of death
        certificates listing the decedent’s home as the location of death (38%);
        these death certificates were less likely to have co-occurring
        chain-of-event diagnoses listed on the death certificate.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        Among death certificates from calendar year 2020 listing COVID-19 and at
        least one other co-occurring diagnosis, the documentation is consistent
        with these deaths being attributable to COVID-19. Specifically, in 97%
        of 357,133 death certificates with COVID-19 and at least one other
        diagnosis, the documented chain-of-event and significant contributing
        conditions were consistent with those reported in clinical and
        epidemiologic studies to occur among patients with severe
        COVID-19–associated outcomes (5,9). Only 5.5% of death certificates had
        COVID-19 without any other conditions listed. Attributability of death
        to COVID-19 could not be evaluated for these death certificates and
        represents an opportunity for improvement in documentation. A small
        proportion (2.5%) of death certificates documented conditions that have
        not currently been described to be associated with COVID-19 critical
        illness or death. This was noted more often among those who died at
        home, declared dead on arrival, and whose manner of death was not
        natural. In particular, a higher percentage of decedents aged 18 years
        (35.2%) and 18–29 years (10.2%) did not have a chain-of-event or
        significant contributing condition listed on the death certificate, even
        though their death certificates did have at least one other diagnosis
        code along with COVID-19 in Part I or II. Although these age categories
        constituted a very small proportion of the entire decedent group, the
        information on the death certificate provides a starting point for
        identification of other conditions that might contribute to mortality in
        younger persons. Detailed evaluation of death certificates might provide
        insights into rare and lesser known conditions that are not yet
        understood to be associated with or contribute to death from COVID-19.
        The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations.
        First, the accuracy of documentation of chain-of-event and significant
        contributing conditions on death certificates is known to be suboptimal
        (10); the effect of COVID-19 on completion of death certificates merits
        further study, with an emphasis on variation by time, jurisdiction in
        which the death occurred, age group, race, ethnicity, and setting of
        death. Second, CDC was unable to compare death certificate data with
        decedent’s medical records or autopsy reports for end-of-life events and
        co-occurring diagnoses. Medical record review is needed to confirm
        findings from this study and elucidate more information for decedents
        with only COVID-19 listed on their death certificate or those that could
        not be plausibly categorized as attributable to COVID-19 based on death
        certificate data alone. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19
        mortality surveillance in the United States using official death
        certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on
        the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative
        public record. Continued messaging to and training of professionals who
        complete death certificates (3) remains important as the pandemic
        progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for
        understanding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants and of COVID-19
        vaccinations and for guiding public health action.
